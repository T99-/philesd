## Philes - The full-featured, web-based, all-around file management system.

Philesd, the server-side daemon/backend of the Philes webapp, is a Java-based file management program that allows a user to access a set of shared files via their browser.


### Planned Features:
- [ ] Real-time updating of the remote filesystem. Multiple users making changes at the same time will be able to see changes being made by other in real time.
- [ ] File uploading, downloading, in-browser viewing, and editing where possible.
- [ ] Multiple file organization options - hierarchical folder (normal filesystem) based, tag based, object based, etc.
- [ ] User based login, logs, access control, commenting, etc.
- [ ] Highly visually customizable - either choose a theme, or set all of your own colors, fonts, etc. If you're really inclined, you can even use your own custom stylesheets.
- [ ] Intuitive and visually-pleasent command line interface for both the server administrator _and_ the end-user.
